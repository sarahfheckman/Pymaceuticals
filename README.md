# Takeaways:
Of the four treatments observed, Capomulin won out in all categories; of the four compared it was the only which showed an average decrease in tumor volume. It also had the highest rate of survival, and was the best at preventing metastatic spread. None of the drugs tested (graphed) were able to completely prevent metastatic spread; the standard errors of each treatment kept most of the data within a pretty set range for all of the drugs involved. More research should be done on how to stop metastatic spread.

# Questions for future research:
1) Were any of the rats fully cured of cancer at the end of 45 days? 
2) How do 45 days scale on treatments in rats vs treatments in humans? What I mean by that is: if this were taken to a human clinical trial, would the timeframe be kept the same?
3) Would these rates of metastatic spread, tumor volume, and survivability stay the same if time and treatment continued or would they plateau at some point?
